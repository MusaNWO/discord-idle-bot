# Discord Employee Time Tracking Bot

A Discord bot that tracks employee work hours with manual check-in/check-out system, automatic idle time tracking, and 40-minute breaks.

## Features

- **Manual Check-In/Check-Out**: Employees check in when starting work and check out when done
- **Automatic Idle Tracking**: Tracks when employees go idle during their shift
- **40-Minute Breaks**: Automatic break timer that ends after 40 minutes
- **Work Statistics**: View detailed stats on hours worked, breaks taken, and active time
- **Live Status**: See who's currently working and their status
- **Persistent Storage**: SQLite database stores all shift history

## Commands

All commands use Discord's slash command system (`/`):

### For Employees

#### `/checkin`
Check in to start your work shift
- Use this when you start working
- You can only check in once at a time
- Your idle time will be automatically tracked

**Example**: `/checkin`

#### `/checkout`
Check out to end your work shift
- Use this when you're done working
- Shows summary of your shift (total time, active time, break time)
- Automatically ends any active breaks

**Example**: `/checkout`

#### `/break`
Start your 40-minute break
- Must be checked in first
- Break automatically ends after 40 minutes
- You'll get notified when break is over
- Only one break at a time

**Example**: `/break`

#### `/mystats [days]`
View your personal work statistics
- `days` (optional): Number of days to look back (default: 7)
- Shows shifts worked, total hours, active hours, break hours
- Shows current shift status if checked in

**Example**: 
- `/mystats` - Last 7 days
- `/mystats 30` - Last 30 days

### For Managers

#### `/whoisin`
See who is currently checked in
- Shows all employees currently working
- Displays their status (online/idle/on break)
- Shows shift duration for each employee
- Shows break time remaining if on break

**Example**: `/whoisin`

#### `/stats @user [days]`
View statistics for any employee
- `user` (required): The employee to check
- `days` (optional): Number of days to look back (default: 7)

**Example**: `/stats @john 14`

## How It Works

### Time Tracking System

1. **Check In**: When you use `/checkin`, your shift starts
2. **During Shift**: 
   - Bot automatically tracks if you're online or idle
   - Idle time is tracked separately
   - You can take a 40-minute break with `/break`
3. **Check Out**: Use `/checkout` to end your shift
   - View summary of total time, active time, and breaks
   - Data is saved to history

### Break System

- Breaks are exactly **40 minutes long**
- Timer starts when you use `/break`
- Break ends automatically after 40 minutes
- You'll get a notification when break is over
- Break time is subtracted from total shift time
- Only one break can be active at a time

### Idle Time Tracking

- Bot monitors your Discord status during shifts
- Tracks when you're:
  - üü¢ **Online** - Counted as active time
  - üü° **Idle** - Tracked separately (future feature)
  - üî¥ **DND** - Counted as active/online
- Only tracked while checked in (not on break)

### Statistics

View detailed breakdowns including:
- **Shifts Worked**: Number of times you checked in/out
- **Total Hours**: Complete shift duration
- **Active Hours**: Time spent active (not on break)
- **Break Hours**: Time spent on breaks
- **Daily Average**: Average hours per day
